# Design for Cooperation 

Co-written and co-taught by Katya Rozanova, Kathy Wu, and Hadass Wade

Design for Cooperation is a practice-based course aimed at engaging new media art, design, and technology students in discussions and field work in mutual aid and civic participation. Students will be connected to civic engagement-centered organizations (Bed Stuy Strong, Chinatown Mutual Aid La, DSA NYC Electoral, Crown Heights Mutual Aid, Black Lives Matter, Indivisible Brooklyn, and others) that they can become temporarily embedded in in order to research and design tools that can support existing efforts.
  
The goal is to encourage research-centered, participatory design and steer students away from the technosoutionist approach to problem-solving that Big Tech has popularized. We hope to unlearn old ways and collectively come up with new questions and new prototypes. We will be relying on principles of the Design Justice Network while keeping our practice open to change.

The role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible.
—Toni Cade Bambara

The contemporary political moment is defined by Emergency… More and more ordinary people are being called to respond in their communities...At its best, mutual aid actually produces new ways of living where people get to create systems of care and generosity that address and foster well-being.
—Dean Spade, Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During this Crisis (and the Next).

This practice-based course is aimed at engaging new media art, design, and technology students in discussions and field work in mutual aid and civic participation. Students will be connected to community-based organizations (CBOs) organizations (Bed Stuy Strong Mutual Aid, Sunnyside Mutual Aid, Defund NYC, Welcome to Chinatown, Housing Justice for All, and others) that they can become temporarily embedded in in order to research and design tools that can support existing efforts. The goal is to encourage research-centered, participatory design and steer students away from the technosoutionist approach to problem-solving that Big Tech has popularized. We hope to unlearn old ways and collectively come up with new questions and new prototypes. We will be relying on principles of the Design Justice Network while keeping our practice open to change.
At the end of the course, we will have researched, prototyped, and tested some ways that design can promote social movements and aid civic organizations' workflows, such as onboarding of participants, preservation and sharing of institutional or collective knowledge, and requesting and dispatching of goods and other exchanges of mutual care outside of existing systems. Most of the work will entail researching, designing, and testing strategies for social systems. While students are likely to also produce supporting, tangible artifacts to these social designs, the production of the artifacts will not be the focus of the course. Examples of student projects or project proposals may resemble the following existing projects: the design of Bed Stuy Strong’ Mutual Aid’s goods dispatching automation system, design of community-generated maps such as scanmap.mobi for up-to-date protest information, Queer Reads Library and Queering the Map, and artistic interventions like Winnie Yoe’s Narratives of Resistance & Resilience, and low-tech public-enacted works such as The Waiting Room by Simone Leigh and Exchange Cafe by Caroline Woolard. 
Student research and documentation will be published in a collective online document that will continually be updated by each student as they learn more and see connections unfold. We hope that this activity will set into motion a life-long practice of observation and experimentation in the field of political collaboration. We believe this unorthodox way of organizing a course, in which students and instructors are co-creating along with civic actors outside of the university, is what will provide the perspective needed to design new ways of relating, of organizing, of building resilient social infrastructure and civil society.

We are socialized to see what is wrong, missing, off, to tear down the ideas of others and uplift our own. To a certain degree, our entire future may depend on learning to listen, listen without assumptions or defenses.

PHASES

Context-building 

We will begin by readings (see below), discussions, and speakers from relevant organizations.  Students will gain knowledge about existing work in the area of civic engagement nas well as the field of socially engaged art and design for social innovation. Students will also become versed in political theory as it pertains to civic society.

Research:  

In the research phase students will be Interviewing organizations and people in communities while volunteering and learning by helping rather than knowledge extraction. Secondary research will include analogous systems, technology used in the field of interest and analogous fields.

Prototyping:  

Co-creation with stakeholders and those of the receiving end of the services will be emphasized. In this way the designs will be designed in a participatory fashion. We will help students with digital and physical prototypes. Tools may include: Figma, HTML and CSS. Physical prototyping (if for mutual aid delivery or meetup activities): paper, cardboard, 3d rendering and printing, and various found materials.

Testing:

User testing methodologies based on the Human-Centered Design framework. 

Sharing knowledge.

Publishing open source documentation, crediting communities with which knowledge was generated, and presenting the findings.

LEARNING OUTCOMES

Students will be versed in political theory as it pertains to civic society and gain: 
experience prototyping and implementing their design or artistic interventions.
skills to co-designing with communities that may or may not be similar to them culturally. Students will also come away with prototyping skills.  
knowledge about existing work in the field of socially engaged art and design for social innovation.
ability to situate themselves within existing efforts and develop a disciplinary focus of their own.

LEARNING ETHOS
Be sensitive to what classmates may find upsetting or triggering.
Work here is towards learning, not towards the sake of work. 
Learning made visible can be a generous and brave practice– for example, changing your mind out loud, or rewriting old writing. Take knowledge as a verb and a progression.

Listen fully to others thoughts before rejecting them.

RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY STATEMENT 

(Credit to Meghan Moe Beitiks for the statement, which we have adapted)

The University is a system built on a legacy of colonialism, ableism, white supremacy, and stolen Native Land. In Queens, we are working on the traditional lands of the Munsee Lenape, Matinecock, and Lekawe people. We aim to resist the narrow focus and values of the structure we are operating within by centralizing marginalized voices and supporting content from a wide variety of artists and histories. This course aims to be a safe and respectful space for students of all cultural and religious backgrounds, while keeping the structural  inequities inherent in our system in mind. Please let us know how best to support your participation in the course, including the accommodation of religious holidays, issues of access, equity or representation.  

All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. In this class, we will have the chance to indicate the name that we prefer to be called  and, if we choose, to identify pronouns with which we would like to be addressed.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF CHALLENGING TIMES  

(Credit to Meghan Moe Beitiks for the statement, which we have adapted)

As humans, we have all been negotiating a global pandemic for the past several years. Many people have lost family and friends, people important to them. Most everyone has been isolated  in their homes, which for many can mean a loss of social support and engagement. For some this means they’ve actually been in a hostile environment. Be kind and respectful to each other. This means having patience not only with your peers but the staff & faculty. Negotiating trauma takes both support and accountability. We will expect you to fulfill course requirements, while  being patient and sympathetic with the difficulty of the times: we ask for this from you in  working with us, your peers, and yourselves, while we strive to do the same. If you have  suggestions for how we might support your learning in this course, during these trying times, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Weeks 1–3
Project 1: Campaign Research Poster


Due date: February 23

In this project, students will familiarize themselves with a local organization and campaign area that they will work with for half of the semester.

For this 3 week project, they will complete secondary research on their chosen area of advocacy. 

They will create a poster/social media graphic that communicates about their movement focus as well as synthesizes a brief history of art and design within that movement. Students will also present their work in class on February 23. 

︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵

Week 1 – Background

Choose an organization, either from this list, or one you are already familiar with. Examples of organizations you might choose are housing justice organizations, mutual aid groups, transit justice, etc.

Week 1 - Homework

Research
Write 2+ short paragraphs to publish to the discord as a PDF. Include:


Your organization’s name and short paragraph description of their current organizing campaigns. 
Who is involved?
What kind of work do they do?
What are their strategies?
Are they part of a larger coalition of multiple organizations?
(etc)


A short paragraph of more general history + context about their area of work in New York City. 
For example, if they are an immigration justice organization, then you should look up the history and broader context of other immigration justice groups in NYC.
Cite at least 2+ sources and include this in your write up.

Reach out!
Reach out via email to ask organizers/volunteers for an interview sometime between 2/24 and 3/9. Remember to introduce yourself, be concise with your message, and to increase the chance of hearing back, suggest some times.

Through the organization, you should sign up for one meeting/event/volunteer opportunities (by Week 2 Feb 9). 

Post the organization and the date you signed up for to the Spreadsheet.


Week 2– Homework- Visual Research

What are ways that design and creative strategies have come into this movement workin the past? Choose an area of social struggle related to your chosen organization, and create a moodboard of 10+ images.

Your visuals can and should span a range of time and mediums. For example, more recently it might be social media graphics, or you might reference posters from fifty years ago.

We want you to be as specific as possible about your particular movement. For instance, whether your area is care work or sex work or abolition or voter advocacy or so on – what are some colors / typographic styles / symbolic motifs to that struggle? Include some descriptions and examples.

Week 3 – Project 1 Due

Submit your project in Discord by the start of class on February 23 and be prepared to share your project with the class.

Option 1   Poster

Make a tabloid poster (11” x 17”) that brings together your visual research and secondary research on your chosen organization.

Option 2   Digital Graphics
 
Create a series of five or more 1:1 square graphics describing your research. The goal is to teach one another and an imaginary larger audience about your area of research. These sizes are optimized for instagram as a jumping off point, but if you want to do a different digital medium, that's fine too.

In your design, make sure to include:


The name of your organization.
Illustrations, photographs, etc
All your written content from week 1, edited
Citations for sources and any images you use
Include a call to action – what can you do to get involved?

For the design aspect, be ready to talk about how the imagery you found in your week 2 research informed your design. For instance, maybe your movement uses certain colors, motifs, typography, textures, those become design elements in your poster as well. Have fun with the design and make it as relevant to your visual research as possible.

For class on zoom, it’s okay if you want to just screenshare a Figma/InDesign/Canva/PDF file instead of printing it out for class.

Weeks 4–8
Project 2: Ready, set, research


Project 2 Due date: March 16.
Service Journey Map.   


In this project, students will practice their primary research skills in the context of a local community organization. Through meetings/volunteer and interviews, they will understand:

Who does the organization work with and support?
What are some of the pain points in the work for the organizers and the people they support?
What are their organizing strategies? 
How does art, design, and creative cultural work play a part in their organizing?

As part of this project, they will create a service journey map and communicate pain points through synthesized interviews and notes. Students will compile these findings in a printed or digital zine.

Week 4 + 5 – Primary Research

We will expect you to complete both interviews and attend an event for your organization in these two weeks. Because scheduling can be unpredictable, you might complete one first before the other. You have two weeks to attend an event or meeting for 1+ hours, and have a 30 minute call.

On the ground
Attend a meeting or event for the organization. 
Either during or after the event, take notes about your experience:


Who was in the room? Who does their work affect? (How much alignment is there between these groups?)
What was on the agenda of the meeting?
Who are some of the “stakeholders” in the work?
What do you notice as potential challenges that they are facing?
What were some of the ongoing campaigns? What were their strategies?
What kind of support is needed for their current work?
Are there any opportunities for design or creative strategy? If there aren’t any, that’s ok! Not every meeting or moment will create opportunities for art or design. Reflect on what they might need most right now based on what you observe.
Outside of your interviewee: Are there additional folks that you might want to get in touch with or interview who seem especially knowledgeable?

Write these notes in a shared doc, and send them to K+K for feedback.

Interview an Organizer
Interview a current organizer from your organization for ~30 minutes in order to understand who their organization supports. Use your interview questions that we will have written in class to try to understand the following:

Who does the organization support? What are their needs?
Describe the types of needs. When, and how, and through what interactions does the org support these needs?
Document where the snags are. 

For your interview, remember to be prepared:


Ask for verbal and written consent to interview, to record, and to transcribe and publish in class.
Get audacity or other recording software.
Have final questions prepared and printed.

From your audio recording, transcribe and take notes from the interview. Make sure that you have at least 3 direct quotes from your interviewee that summarize your conversation. Try to communicate with these quotes: What is unique about this organization, from their point of view? What are the pain points? 


Week 6  — Service Journey Map

Create a service journey map showing the interactions (touch points) between the receiver of service and the organization.

Through sketches, propose 3 ways that you might use creative strategy and design to alleviate, support, ease, intervene.

Weeks 7 + 8 — Personas, Storyboarding

User personas
Design a user persona based on your interview. What is this person doing, thinking, feeling? What are their pain points?

Storyboarding
Based on your journey map, draw two storyboards:
one for the existing user experience
one with the new user experience which integrates your service idea

Due: May 12

In these weeks, we will focus on building a tangible experience or campaign for your persona. We’ll also learn how to conduct usability tests and ask for feedback from a stakeholder.

Week 9
Finish digital interactive prototypes we do in class. Post link to discord

Start *lo-fi* prototyping your solution that you developed in your storyboard.
If it’s an interactive digital one, make a rough figma prototype to test for the next class. 
If it’s print, make a rough draft of the print material. 
If it’s a print outreach campaign, draw what it would look like if installed, posted
Since our projects are all different, it may be tricky to find just one way to prototype so ask us if you need help with making those decisions.

Week 10

Part 1
Reach out to your organization again to ask if they will be able to give you written or live feedback. Ask them for feedback before Week 13, or 5/04.

Write up 3 questions you would want answered through your testing.


Part 2
If you haven’t already, turn your low-fidelity prototype into high fidelity graphics. Make it look visually like a finished website/app/interface/experience.

For both digital and non-digital projects
Fully draft a summary of improvements based on user feedback
Iterate on the prototype

Winnie Yoe, Title IX Investigations


Week 11 – Start Testing & Iterate


In your groups during class, you will run a usability test on other groups for feedback on your primary prototype.

Our goal with usability testing is less about the concept, and more about making sure our project is clear and easy to understand. Obviously, this won’t be as impactful as running feedback sessions with actual stakeholders, but we can still catch areas of confusions and areas for improvement.


You’ll want your final project to be a holistic design system. 

Consider outreach and/or additional services. If you’ve created an app, then consider non-digital forms of outreach, or street side intervention. If you’ve created posters, consider a digital outreach component. Consider an event you might propose to promote your service or product.

Draw + mockup 1-2 of these ideas by the next class.

Hackathon — FEMINIST FUTURES


Winnie Yoe, Interpreting Hong Kong Police Narratives


Week 12 – Iterate

Identify 2-3 areas of change to make from your usability tests + stakeholder interviews. Make these changes to your prototype for next week.




Week 15 –Case Study– due May 18

Revisit your 6+ slide Figma document which includes the following:
The name of your organization
A paragraph about your organization (you can use what you write in Project 1)
3+ observations from your meeting
3+ direct quotes from your interviewee
Service journey map with 3+ clearly stated pain points
Link to your prototype

In figma, create a polished, well-designed research deck for your case study. You can get as visually creative as you would like. 
Make sure to include the following sections: 
overview, your role, tools you used, what form your final design took (poster, mobile app, etc), 
context 
problem statement, 
solution statement
process 
research questions
primary and secondary research
user journey & pain points
in-depth problem and solution
testing & iteration
reflections. 

These should be beautiful, finished looking pages that you could potentially share in a presentation. (You should use Prototype mode to link your slides together.) Your design should embody a visual style which is relevant to your campaign area.

Here are some examples of activist publications which merge research findings + pull quotes beautifully — some which are more traditional print layouts, others which are created specifically for the web.

🌻 Week 9 HW

Finish digital interactive prototypes we do in class. Post link to discord
Start *lo-fi* prototyping your solution that you developed in your storyboard.
If it’s an interactive digital one, make a rough figma prototype to test for the next class. 
If it’s print, make a rough draft of the print material. 
If it’s a print outreach campaign, draw what it would look like if installed, posted
Since our projects are all different, it may be tricky to find just one way to prototype so ask us if you need help with making those decisions.

Improve prototype and make it higher fidelity. Second round of prototyping












🌻 Week 11 HW

In your groups during class, you will run a usability test on other groups for feedback on your primary prototype.

Our goal with usability testing is less about the concept, and more about making sure our project is clear and easy to understand. Obviously, this won’t be as impactful as running feedback sessions with actual stakeholders, but we can still catch areas of confusions and areas for improvement.

Week 12 April 27
Project 3: Prototyping Due
Present: What did you improve?
Did you hear back from your contact and did they did they have suggestions?
What is your favorite part about your design and what do you think you could develop more if you had more time?


Lecture: Introduce Project 4–case studies



🌻 Week 12 HW

Preparing your case study:
Write about your iteration process for your prototype. Summarize the feedback you received.  Show us before and after screens that explain where and how you implemented your findings from usability testing. 
You can find an example of discussing iteration here: https://www.hadasswade.com/mywork/befriend under “Prototypes and Testing”

This is part of the case study you’ll complete by our last class period. You can do this in Figma and export as a .pdf. This is a continuation of what we started in week 9.
